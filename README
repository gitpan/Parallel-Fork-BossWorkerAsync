Parallel-Fork-BossWorkerAsync version 0.03
==========================================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

NOTE: on BSD systems you probably don't want to run the test t/large_return.t. It takes
nine minutes on my Darwin 12.4.0 (Mountain Lion) Mac. The problem is the 8k limit on
the socket read buffer, enforced by the OS. It's only an issue on BSD, and if you're
passing megabyte chunks of data between processes. More details in the man page.

To avoid the test, simply move t/large_return.t to another directory.

DEPENDENCIES

  Data::Dumper, Carp, IO::Select, Socket, Fcntl, POSIX
