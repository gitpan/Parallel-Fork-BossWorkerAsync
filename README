Parallel-Fork-BossWorkerAsync version 0.03
==========================================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

There is an extra test that's not in the MANIFEST, called t/large_return.t. You
may wish to include it. The reason it's not part of the default build is that
on BSD systems it takes well over five minutes to execute (9 minutes on Darwin
12.4.0 Mountain Lion). The problem is the 8k limit on the socket read buffer.
It's only an issue on BSD, and if you're passing megabyte chunks of data
between processes. More details in the man page.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Data::Dumper, Carp, IO::Select, Socket, Fcntl, POSIX
