Revision history for Perl extension Parallel::Fork::BossWorkerAsync.

0.08 2013-09-09
  - Remove large_return.t from the build, so as not to break BSD builds.

0.07 2013-09-05
  - Optimize socket read buffer size; make it configurable.
  - Fix incorrect C-style fork() error return (perl returns undef, not -1).
  - Fix overly aggressive child process reaping. Now you can fork() within
    your work_handler and the module won't reap the completed process out from
    under you. Thanks to Rob Navarro for both of these fixes.

0.06 2010-12-03
  - Test for, and bail on, Windows.

0.05 2009-12-12
  - Worker callback errors no longer cause child to exit.
  - Introduce ERROR hash key into result.
  - Wait for all child workers to be reaped before exiting boss.
    - This will hopefully clean up the non-Windows test failures.

0.04 2009-09-13
  - Improve error messages.
